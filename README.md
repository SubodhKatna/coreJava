Welcome to my **Core Java Learning Journey** 🚀  
This repository represents a **structured, topic-wise implementation of Core Java**, built to strengthen fundamentals, OOP concepts, and modern Java features with real code examples.

It is designed for:
- Concept clarity  
- Hands-on practice  
- Interview preparation  
- Strong backend foundations  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master **Core Java fundamentals**
- Build deep understanding of **OOP principles**
- Learn **exception handling, collections, multithreading**
- Write **clean, modular, and readable code**
- Prepare for **Java interviews & backend development**

---

## 📂 Project Structure Overview

The project is organized into **topic-centric packages**, mirroring how Java should be learned step by step.

---

## 🔹 Basics (`basics/`)

Covers the core building blocks of Java programming.
- Data types (primitive, reference, casting)
- Operators (arithmetic, logical, relational, ternary)
- Program structure (comments, printing)
- User input using `Scanner`
- Variables and scope

---

## 🔹 Control Flow (`controlflow/`)

Controls the execution flow of a Java program:
- Decision making (`if`, `else`, `else-if`, `switch`)
- Looping (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Branching statements (`break`, `continue`)

---

## 🔹 Arrays (`arrays/`)

Working with one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays:
- Basic array operations (initialize, traverse, insert, update, delete)
- Searching algorithms (linear, binary)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick)
- Matrix initialization and traversal
- Advanced traversals (boundary, spiral, snake, column)

---

## 🔹 Strings (`strings/`)

String handling and manipulation:
- String basics and introduction
- String methods and character operations
- Mutable strings (`StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`)
- Modern string features and advanced operations 

---

## 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (`oops/`)

Core OOP concepts with practical examples:
- Classes and objects, constructors, and multi-file programs
- Encapsulation (basics and advanced usage)
- Abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces
- Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical, HAS-A)
- polymorphism (compile-time overloading, runtime overriding)
- Object class methods

---

## 🔹 Exception Handling (`exceptionhandling/`)

Handling runtime errors and exceptional cases:
- Exception basics and categorization (checked vs unchecked)
- `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`
- Custom exceptions and real-world examples
- Best practices for exception handling

---

## 🔹 IO Operations (`iooperations/`)

Working with files and input/output:
- Byte streams and character streams
- File handling and management
- Serialization and deserialization
- NIO (`Files`, `Path` APIs) 

---

## 🔹 Collections (`collections/`)

Working with the Java Collections Framework:
- Lists, Sets, Queues, and Maps
- Iteration using cursors
- Sorting collections
- Map fundamentals and advanced usage

---

## 🔹 Multithreading (`multithreading/`)

Concurrent programming in Java:
- Thread creation and lifecycle
- Inter-thread communication
- Synchronization and locking
- Modern concurrency (Executors, Callables, Futures)
- Common multithreading problems

---

## 🔹 Generics (`generics/`)

Type-safe programming in Java:
- Generic classes and methods
- Wildcards and bounded types
 
---

## 🔹 Java 8 Features (`java8features/`)

Modern Java programming concepts:
- Lambda expressions
- Functional interfaces
- Streams (creation, operations, terminal methods)
- Optional class
- Date and Time API

---
